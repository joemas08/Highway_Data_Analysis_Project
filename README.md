# Highway_Data_Analysis_Project
This project was my final project in my Python course. I was given the theoretical issue that there were speeders on the main highway in the State of Happiness. The Happiness State Troopers implemented a system that tracked vehicle's journeys from exit to exit . I wrote the program to process their data with a full report including graphs.
